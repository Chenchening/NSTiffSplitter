How to use it
==========================

NSTiffSplitter is an Objective-C class which allow you to show multipage TIFF files on iPad / iPhone / iPod Touch. Use it in two steps:

1) Create NSTiffSplitter instance:

- (id) initWithData:(NSData *)imgData usingMapping:(BOOL)usingMapping;
or
- (id) initWithPathToImage:(NSString *)imgPath;
Second method always use mapping.

2) Get any page of tiff file with next method:
- (NSData *) dataForImage:(NSUInteger)imageIndex;
It's returns montage tiff file for every page of multipage tiff file.

You can get count of images in file with countOfImages property.
